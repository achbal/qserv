#
# The Qserv installer configuration file.
#
# Used to build and install Qserv
# Run "scons --help" to get a list of available options of the installer
#
# You can copy this file to "~/lsst/qserv.conf"
# in order to use Qserv client tools like :
# - qserv-test-integration.py,
# - qserv-check-integration.py
#
# This file relies on Python templating system i.e. each %(variable_name)s will be replaced by the value of variable_name
# Commented values are the defaults
#
# WARNING : underneath variables mustn't be changed once the install process is started
#
# For explanations see
