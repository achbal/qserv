Module defining WorkerAdmin class and related methods.

WorkerAdmin is an interface which controls or communicates with qserv
worker instance. Exact form of control is still to be defined, for now
we are going to support communication with mysql instance or ability to
start/stop worker processes. Current implementation is based on SSH
tunneling (or direct mysql connection if possible), in the future there
is supposed to be a special service for worker administration.

WorkerAdmin uses information about worker nodes defined in Qserv CSS, for
details see https://dev.lsstcorp.org/trac/wiki/db/Qserv/CSS#Node-related.
For testing purposes it it also possible to provide worker information as
a set of parameters to constructor.
