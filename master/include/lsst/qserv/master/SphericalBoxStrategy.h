// SphericalBoxStrategy is a class designed to abstract the
// computations and constructs that are specific to the spherical-box
// style of partitioning. Ideally, we would have an abstract strategy
// class as an interface that all partitioning strategies would share,
// but this is difficult to do without at least one other strategy and
// we don't have the resources (yet) to implement another strategy.
