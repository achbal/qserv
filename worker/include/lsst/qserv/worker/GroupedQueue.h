/// GroupedQueue is a queue of elements grouped by a key
/// value. New elements are inserted by finding the right-most element
/// that shares its key with the new element and inserting the new
/// value after the found element. If no key-sharing element is found,
/// the new element is placed at the back.
///
/// The intent is that GroupedQueue behaves just like a queue, except
/// that new elements can go earlier if they have friends already in
/// line. This is used to handle "interactive" queries in a roughly
/// FIFO ordering, with opportunistic reuse of chunk I/O when
/// possible. Because of line-jumping, there is a chance for
/// starvation if these queries are not interactive. Starvation is
/// mitigated by a parameter which limits the size of the group of
/// "friends".
///
/// deque is chosen as the underlying data structure. A deque of lists
/// of elements was considered, in order to eliminate the O(n)
/// insertion penalty, but is probably unnecessary, because n should
/// be small.
///
/// Note: Because STL deque::insert always inserts *before* an
/// element, and we want new elements to be logically inserted after
/// the last element of their group, the deque operates reversed:
/// i.e., _deque.front() is the back of the queue and _deque.back() is
/// the front of the queue.
