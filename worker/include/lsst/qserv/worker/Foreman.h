//  class Foreman -- A class that implements a pooling thread manager.
//  The Foreman is parameterized with a scheduling algorithm that
//  decides what tasks to run from a TodoList and how many threads can
//  be allocated.  Thus the thread count is not fixed.  Foreman
//  provides the scheduler with a TodoList and a list of current work,
//  so that the scheduler can use resources efficiently and leverage
//  "synergies" (e.g., I/O reuse) when possible.
//
//  Approach: Using WorkQueue's API as a starting point, expand to
//  include a pluggable scheduler API and fill in the plumbing to make
//  sure the scheduler can see queued and running tasks. 
// 
//  The scheduler must be defined to handle multiple scheduling events:
//  nop: nothing has happened (no-operation) in terms of new tasks or
//  task completions, but the scheduler may decide that additional
//  execution is appropriate according to its own metrics.
//  newTask: a new task has arrived
//  taskFinish: a task has completed. The first Task returned by the
//  scheduler (if any) should be executed by the finishing thread.
//
//  The Foreman was originally intended to be as generic as WorkQueue,
//  but its dependencies mean that much of its work would become
//  templated or polymorphic, with little obvious value at this point
//  in development, aside from increased testability.  The affected
//  classes include at least: Task, TodoList, QueryRunner. Those that
//  depend on them would need tweaks, but should be able to escape
//  templating or polymorphism.
