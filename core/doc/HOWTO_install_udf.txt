qserv relies on spatial UDFs installed on the worker nodes.

"""
The other thing that is not automatic in all of this is the installation  
of the UDFs themselves. To start using them, one needs to copy  
bld/udf/libqserv_udf.so to $MYSQL_SERVER_DIR/lib/mysql/plugin and then run  
the udf/createMySqlUdfs.sql script.
