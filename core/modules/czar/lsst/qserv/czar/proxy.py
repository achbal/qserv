## lsst.qserv.czar.proxy
# A package providing helper logic to interface with the mysql proxy.
# Code that is related to interaction with the mysqlproxy interface
# should reside here.  This includes code to manage the lock-tables
# that are used to by the qserv frontend to block the proxy while
# queries are being processed, while not blocking the Lua scripting
# layer inside the proxy.  Blocking in the Lua scripting layer
# effectively blocks all query processing in the proxy, since the Lua
# instance is single-threaded.
