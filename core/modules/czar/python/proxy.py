## lsst.qserv.czar.proxy
# A package providing helper logic to interface with the mysql proxy.
# Code that is related to interaction with the mysqlproxy interface
# should reside here.  This includes code to manage the lock-tables
# that are used to by the qserv frontend to block the proxy while
# queries are being processed, while not blocking the Lua scripting
# layer inside the proxy.  Blocking in the Lua scripting layer
# effectively blocks all query processing in the proxy, since the Lua
# instance is single-threaded.

class Lock:
    """The Lock class manages the table locking mechanism used to
    allow the mysql-proxy to effectively wait for a query's completion
    by the czar without blocking. This is achieved by including a
    table-lock acquired by the czar during query submission. The
    mysql-proxy is advised of the name of the locked table, and is
    instructed to query its associated results-hosting mysqld after
    acquiring a lock on the table. mysql-proxy can service other
    requests when it is waiting on mysql queries that it knowingly
    initiates in its C-layer, whereas it treats its Lua plugin code as a
    single-threaded black-box."""
